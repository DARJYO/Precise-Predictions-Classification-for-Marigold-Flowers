# Precise-Predictions-Classification-for-Marigold-Flowers

A modern web application that uses machine learning to classify different varieties of Marigold flowers using TensorFlow.js and React.

## Features

- ðŸŒ¼ Real-time Marigold flower classification
- ðŸ“¸ Drag-and-drop image upload interface
- ðŸš€ Fast and responsive user experience
- ðŸ’ª Built with modern technologies
- ðŸ“± Mobile-friendly design

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/darjyo/precise-predictions-classification-for-marigold-flowers.git
cd precise-predictions-classification-for-marigold-flowers
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Upload an image of a Marigold flower either by:
   - Dragging and dropping an image onto the upload area
   - Clicking the upload area to select an image from your device
3. Wait for the classification results
4. View the predicted Marigold variety
